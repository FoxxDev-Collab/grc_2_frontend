Client Pages
- Implement the in-depth Audit component, this should look deeply within the organization.
-- Requires documentation, artifacts, etc.

System/ATO Pages:
- Enhance "Components" with HW/SW list with custom fields or from a database/prefilled options.
- NIST RMF will be the focus.
-- Starting with creating database files for Low/Medium/High categories in the CIA Triad.
-- This will require heavy backend configuration. We will start with a catalog that clients will
map their system to, or import the catalog.
-- Hybrid approach of grc_system database and client databases

ATO Phases need forms:
src\components\system_ato
- Initial Assessment needs to be broken down into forms
-- Components, Software, Hardware
-- Ports, Protocols, Procedures

GRC_System Database configuration
/grc_database
  /clients.sqlite
  /grc_users.sqlite
  /nist_catalog_rev5_low.sqlite
  /nist_catalog_rev5_medium.sqlite

Client Database configuration         # This should be the baseline, each client should be structured lik this
/databases
  /client_123/
    client.sqlite      # Client-specific data
    systems.sqlite     # Systems for this client
    users.sqlite       # Users for this client
    artifacts.sqlite   # Artifacts for this client
    system-ato.sqlite  # ATO specific, mapping artifacts and controls

  /Security controls
    /Overview
    /Baseline Selection = contains selection and justification (currently focusing on LOW for now)
    /Control Details = move the component with tabs to here, this will be an information page with the nist_catalog_rev5_low/ components
    /Implentation = this is where the user will mark the status of the control (Compliant, Non-Compliant, Not-Applicable, Pending Review), provide less than 200 characters of the testing, map artifacts to the control.
