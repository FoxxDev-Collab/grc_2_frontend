# ATO as a Service: Detailed Phase Procedures

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment

### 1.1 System Discovery
- Conduct initial system inventory
- Document system purpose and functions
- Identify system components and boundaries
- Map data flows and interconnections
- Review existing security documentation



### 1.2 Environment Analysis
- Evaluate hosting environment (Cloud/On-Prem/Hybrid)
- Document infrastructure components
- Review network architecture
- Assess system dependencies
- Identify critical system interfaces

### 1.3 Stakeholder Analysis
- Document system owners and operators
- Map security responsibilities
- Establish points of contact
- Define communication channels

## Phase 2: System Categorization

### 2.1 Information Types

- Map regulatory requirements
- Define data ownership
- Document data flows

### 2.2 Impact Analysis
- Assess confidentiality impact
- Evaluate integrity impact
- Determine availability impact
- Document impact rationale
- Define system categorization within CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

### 2.3 Security Objectives
- Document security objectives
- Define protection requirements
- Identify critical functions
- Map business impact
- Establish security priorities

## Phase 3: Security Control Selection and Implementation
